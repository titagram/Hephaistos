# Hades Operations

## Jobs

Backend jobs are pulled by Hades during manual sync and lightweight piggyback
sync. Jobs are capability-scoped and bounded to a linked workspace.

Initial read-only capabilities:

- `read_files`
- `project_inspection`
- `sync_git_tree`
- `populate_backend_ast`

Large or policy-gated jobs are stored as `waiting_confirmation` until the user
approves or the deadline expires.

## Artifacts

`sync_git_tree` produces `hades.git_tree.v1` artifacts with path, size, hash,
and truncation metadata. `populate_backend_ast` produces `hades.symbols.v1`
artifacts with symbols and provenance, not raw source.

## Persephone

Persephone is the MVP realtime/inbox layer for communication between Hades
instances. It is not the primary job channel. Jobs remain pull/piggyback so
headless installations continue to work.

The first MVP contract is persistent inbox plus SSE or polling fallback. Hades
stores inbox events locally and surfaces unread/degraded state in status.
